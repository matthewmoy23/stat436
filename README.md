The application I developed visualizes and compares baseball player statistics between 2020 and 2024. The primary goal of the application is to assist baseball analysts and enthusiasts in exploring how different performance metrics, such as Batting Average (AVG), Strikeout Rate (K%),  Slugging Percentage (SLG), etc. evolve and compare over time for multiple players. The app also supports comparing these stats between individual players.
